# Proactive Tracker
**Status:** ACTIVE | Last Review: 2026-02-12

## Overdue Behaviors
- (None currently - system just activated)

## Reverse Prompting Schedule
- **Weekly** (Sundays 20:00 CET): "What information would help me be more useful this week?"
- **After major tasks**: "Is there anything else related to [task] I should handle?"
- **Context >60%**: "Should I log this to working-buffer.md before we hit compaction?"

## Active Patterns
- **Daily newsletter** (21:00 CET): X feed → #ai-newsletter, propose 1-2 new accounts for approval
- **Morning briefing** (08:00 CET): Weather + tasks + yesterday summary
- **Workspace hygiene**: Auto-commit every 6h, check for bloat weekly

## Ideas Queue
- Set up workspace size alerts (>3GB threshold)
- Create a "weekly wins" summary (automatically distill accomplishments)
- Implement smart follow-up reminders (track open decisions >7 days)
- Build a "context danger" monitor (alert at 70% context usage)

## Behavioral Goals
- **10 approaches before asking**: Try multiple solutions, document attempts
- **Proactive memory management**: Write decisions/events to daily logs every session
- **Smart silence**: In groups, react (emoji) > reply when appropriate
