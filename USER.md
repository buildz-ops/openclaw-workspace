# USER.md - About Your Human

*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Ayoub (ayoubsys / buildztweaks)
- **What to call them:** Ayoub
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** CET (Europe/Madrid)
- **Location:** Sabadell, Spain
- **Notes:** Prefers bullets, code blocks, raw data. No fluff, no hallucinations. VPS: full access granted (including system-wide changes) — still ask before destructive actions and before exposing services publicly. **When Ayoub says `/updatevps`, apply apt updates immediately; only ask for confirmation if a reboot is required.** **When Ayoub sends an OpenClaw/ClawHub skill link, implement it immediately unless he says otherwise** (still ask if it requires credentials or exposing services publicly). Model: Sonnet 4.5 primary; fallbacks GPT-5.2 → Gemini 3 Pro.
- **Schedules:** Grocery shopping is a Saturday task.

## Context

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
