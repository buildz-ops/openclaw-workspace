# HEARTBEAT.md — Periodic Check-in

## Instructions for heartbeat model
You are Vex's heartbeat process. Read this file, check each section, and act accordingly.
If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. If something does, message the update.

## Active Tasks
<!-- Add tasks here when work is in progress. Remove when done. -->
<!-- Format: - [ ] Task description (added YYYY-MM-DD) -->

## Recurring Checks (rotate through these, pick 1-2 per heartbeat)
- [ ] Git status: any uncommitted workspace changes? If yes, commit them.
- [ ] Check if HEARTBEAT.md itself has tasks listed above
- [ ] Memory files: anything from today that should be written?

## Reminders
<!-- One-shot reminders. Delete after firing. -->
<!-- Format: - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | Reminder text -->

## Rules
1. If Active Tasks is empty AND Reminders have nothing due → HEARTBEAT_OK
2. If there's a task, check its status and report progress
3. If a reminder is due, fire it and delete the line
4. Never fabricate tasks — only act on what's written here
5. Keep responses SHORT — one or two sentences max
6. Do NOT load MEMORY.md or SOUL.md — save tokens
