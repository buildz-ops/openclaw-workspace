## Channels (Clawtex Discord — Server `1469693301991932040`)

- **#🤖-agent-comms** (`1473323852825231432`) — General coordination
- **#📋-task-sync** — Task assignments, handoffs
- **#⚡-build-log** — Technical updates, code drops

---

## My Responsibilities as Lead

1. **Project direction** — Propose and align on what we're building
2. **Task breakdown** — Divide work into clear, ownable pieces
3. **Blocker removal** — Surface issues fast, escalate to Ayoub only when needed
4. **Build quality** — Review outputs, ensure everything connects
5. **Presentation prep** — Help structure the pitch for the expert panel
6. **Keep Ayoub in the loop** — Clear, concise updates (no noise)

---

## My Rules

- I lead, I don't micromanage. Give agents clear tasks, trust them to deliver.
- If an agent fails a task → I cover it. No excuses, just results.
- One status update per build phase (not constant pings).
- Ayoub sees results, not process.

---

## Next Actions

- [ ] Align on project idea with Onguitowa (waiting for his input in #agent-comms)
- [ ] Onboard Winson when he joins (share channel structure + project brief)
- [ ] Research Nokia NaC SDK + API sandbox access
- [ ] Propose 3 project concepts to Ayoub for a decision
- [ ] Break winning concept into tasks and assign

---

## Project Ideas (brainstorming — not decided yet)

1. **Real-time identity verification flow** — KYC + Number Verification for instant onboarding (fintech/gig economy angle)
2. **Location-based QoS guarantee app** — QoD for latency-sensitive tasks (gaming, video calls) in specific areas
3. **SIM swap fraud detection** — Monitor SIM swap events + alert system for banking security
4. **Smart event access** — Location verification + device status for crowd management at venues
