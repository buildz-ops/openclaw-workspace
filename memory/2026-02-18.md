## Clawtex Website Deployment
- **Domains:** `clawtex.es`, `clawtex.com` (currently on GoDaddy).
- **Plan:** Migrate domains to Cloudflare for better automation, security, and speed.
- **Status:**
    - Ayoub sent **Cloudflare Member invite** (Admin role) to `vex00x00@gmail.com`.
    - Ayoub sent **GoDaddy Delegate invite** (Manage Products) to `vex00x00@gmail.com`.
    - **GoDaddy:** Access **CONFIRMED** (Accepted via browser automation). Delegate access confirmed in browser session.
    - **Cloudflare:** Invite received and clicked. Logged in. `clawtex.com` added to Cloudflare (Free plan).
- **Current Step:**
    - **`clawtex.com`**:
        - Site added to Cloudflare.
        - **Nameservers assigned:** `june.ns.cloudflare.com` and `micah.ns.cloudflare.com`.
        - **Action needed:** Update nameservers in GoDaddy.
    - **`clawtex.es`**:
        - Needs to be added to Cloudflare.
        - Nameservers need to be updated in GoDaddy.
- **Blocker (GoDaddy):**
    - Navigated to GoDaddy Portfolio (`dcc.godaddy.com`).
    - **Issue:** The portfolio view shows "No registered domains" (No hay dominios registrados).
    - **Reason:** Likely viewing `vex`'s empty account instead of Ayoub's delegated account.
    - **Fix:** Need to switch account context in GoDaddy to Ayoub's account to see/manage the domains.
