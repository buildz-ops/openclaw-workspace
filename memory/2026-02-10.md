# 2026-02-10

## Discord DM Access Fix
- Applied `channels.discord.dm.policy: "allowlist"` + `allowFrom: ["281112594348244993"]` to enable DM access for Ayoub
- Previously DMs were blocked because only guild channels were configured

## #ai-news Channel Incident (Part 2)
- **Status: STOPPED** — User reported continued spam in #ai-news (1466764486286250240) at 11:09 AM (17 mins after initial "resolution").
- **Action:** Restarted Gateway to kill all active sessions/loops immediately.
- **Root Cause:** Suspected a lingering sub-agent or retry loop related to processing the +100 bookmarks for the newsletter.
- **Fix:** Verify no bookmark-processing scripts are running automatically on start.

## Mission Control / Bookmarks
- User requested to "clean" #ai-news and leave only the final artifacts.
- I uploaded `clawtex/bookmarks/outputs/dashboard.html` (X Bookmarks Dashboard).
- I informed the user I cannot bulk-delete messages (Discord API limitation for bots without specific permissions/endpoints).

## Model Config Changes
- Switched primary model from `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (to bypass cooldowns)
- Google and GitHub Copilot auth profiles were in cooldown (~55min) at time of restart
- This change should be reverted once cooldowns expire if user prefers Gemini

## Session Context
- Main session (agent:main:main) was at 100% context, gateway restart brought it to 76%
- #health channel session was auto-cleared by gateway restart
- Health report: Mac Mini uptime 1d14h, disk 7%, memory healthy, Tailscale connected
