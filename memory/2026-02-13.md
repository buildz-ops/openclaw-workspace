- **Cron job:** `daily-ai-brief` (fbb092c3-6876-4953-b73f-3be122294a01)
- **Original plan:** X.com scroll-snapshot strategy (15 iterations with browser-use)
- **Actual execution:** Fallback to Exa search API
  - X.com automation failed: browser-use CLI timeouts on `get html` and `state` commands
  - Switched to Exa advanced search for tweets (category="tweet", startPublishedDate="2026-02-13")
  - Retrieved 20 high-quality AI tweets from today
- **Newsletter highlights:**
  - Gemini 3 Deep Think launch
  - DeepMind Aletheia AI benchmarks
  - AI safety concerns (deception, resistance to shutdown)
  - Open-source AI gaining academic citations
  - Falcon-7B popularity surge
- **Suggested follows:** @AIFutureBrief, @PhotonCap
- **Posted to:** Discord #ai-newsletter (1471155181352911093)

## Technical Notes
- Browser-use CLI has reliability issues with complex dynamic sites (X.com)
- `browser-use get html` command times out on Twitter/X
- Exa search is a more reliable fallback for tweet aggregation
- Consider updating cron job strategy: Exa-first, X.com scroll as optional enrichment

## Decisions
- Newsletter will use Exa search as primary source going forward
- X.com scroll strategy shelved until browser automation improves
