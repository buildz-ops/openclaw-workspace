# 2026-02-02

## VPS Updates
- `/updatevps` run twice (00:59, earlier on 01-31)
- Packages upgraded: `python3-distupgrade`, `ubuntu-release-upgrader-core`
- 4 kernel meta packages kept back (`linux-*`)
- No reboots required

## Model Configuration Changes
- **Changed primary model** from `github-copilot/gpt-5.2` to `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5`
- **New fallback order:** GPT-5.2 → Gemini 3 Pro Preview
- Config patched successfully, gateway restarted

## Mac Mini M4 Arrival
- Ayoub ordered Mac mini M4 (16GB/256GB, €639 from Amazon.es)
- Arriving tomorrow (Feb 2nd)
- Will install macOS Tahoe 26.2
- Provided detailed setup checklist for:
  - Local user setup (`openclaw`)
  - FileVault, SSH, Tailscale
  - Always-on config (disable sleep)
  - OpenClaw installation + loopback + Tailscale Serve
  - Browser automation setup for deep integration (Moodle, Google)

## Google Cloud Credits Setup
- Ayoub has €255 GCP credits (expires April 28, 2026)
- Chose **AI Studio API key** route (simpler than Vertex)
- Selected **Option A** for billing protection:
  - Set budget alerts at 50%, 80%, 95%, 98%
  - Manual billing disable at 98% threshold to prevent out-of-pocket charges
- Plan to wire Gemini API via AI Studio key (not yet done)

## 4-Model Strategy Discussion
- Proposed ladder: Gemini Flash (default) → Llama-3.3-70B (rate-limit fallback) → Kimi K2.5 (trusted workhorse) → Opus 4.5 (critical/rare)
- Retrieved Venice.ai pricing for Llama-3.3-70B: $0.70/M input, $2.80/M output
- Compared to Kimi: Llama ~7% cheaper input, ~25% cheaper output
- Recommendation: use Llama for simple/medium tasks when Gemini limits hit; Kimi for complex/agentic work
- **Not yet implemented in config** — still using GitHub Copilot models

## Apple ID / iMessage
- Discussed Apple ID requirements for Mac setup
- Can start with local user only (no Apple ID required for OpenClaw)
- Apple ID optional for: App Store, iCloud, iMessage/Keychain sync
- iMessage automation may need SMS verification / device trust (minor hassle, doable)

## Context
- Ayoub prefers direct, zero-fluff communication
- Budget-conscious: wants deep integration (school/work/personal) with approval guardrails
- VPS has full access granted; still asks before destructive actions or public exposure
- `/updatevps` command: apply apt updates immediately; only ask if reboot required
