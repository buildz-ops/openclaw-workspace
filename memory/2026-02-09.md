## Mission Control Dashboard — COMPLETE
- Built full Tauri + Next.js "Mission Control" dashboard for OpenClaw
- Dark glassmorphism design, SF Pro fonts, real gateway data
- Pages: Dashboard, Sessions, Agents, Cron Jobs, Workshop, Journal, API Usage, Documents
- Two .app builds created: Mac Mini (localhost) + MacBook (Tailscale)
- Placed in `~/Desktop/Mission Control Builds/`
- Sidebar branded "Vex" with idle/working/offline status + hover popup
- Architecture documented: `mission-control/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Project path: `/Users/vex/.openclaw/workspace/mission-control/`

## Discord DM Access Enabled
- Added `channels.discord.dm.policy: "allowlist"` with `allowFrom: ["281112594348244993"]`
- Default was `"pairing"` which blocked DMs

## Model Switch
- Switched primary to `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` (Google + GitHub Copilot auth profiles hit cooldowns)
- User prefers Gemini when available — restore when cooldown expires

## Open Issues
- **#ai-news** (1466764486286250240): Gets @mentions (👀 ack), but no text response spawned. Works in all other channels. Needs full gateway stop/start (not hot-reload). Never worked per Ayoub.
- **#❤️health** (1466493560290283635): Was at 100% context, compaction approved by user.

## Dev Tools Installed on Mac Mini
- Chrome, yt-dlp, ffmpeg, Rust 1.93.0
