- Multiple sessions hit capacity today: main session (87%, 92%, 94%, 97%, 99%), #ai-newsletter (100%), #❤️health (100% twice)

## Output Bug (CRITICAL)
- **Issue:** Internal reasoning/thinking leaked into Discord messages multiple times
- **User Reaction:** "why are you talking like this?" and "still doing it" with screenshot evidence
- **Cause:** Narration text appearing in message body instead of being internal only
- **Status:** Acknowledged, attempting to fix by being more careful with message formatting
- **Note:** Must ensure thinking/reasoning stays internal and only final response text is sent to Discord
