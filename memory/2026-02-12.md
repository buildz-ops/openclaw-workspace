## Tasks
- [x] **Minimax M2.5 Stress Test:** Verified model performance with a cyberpunk creative writing task + Python acrostic verifier. Model felt "punchy" and "loose" compared to Sonnet/Gemini.
- [x] **Mac Status Board:** Built a lightweight, real-time system monitor for the Mac Mini M4.
  - **Tech Stack:** Node.js, Express, Socket.io, SystemInformation, Chart.js.
  - **Design:** Apple "Liquid Glass" aesthetic (dark mode, backdrop-filter, translucency).
  - **Location:** `workspace/mac-status-board`.
  - **Access:** `http://100.70.208.116:3333` (Tailscale) or port 3333 locally.
  - **Features:** Live CPU/RAM/Network graphs, tabbed interface, responsive glass UI.

## Notes
- **Minimax M2.5 Observation:** Good for creative vibes, less rigorous than Sonnet. "Hallucinates with confidence" but is fun.
- **Mission Control vs. Status Board:** The new board is a lightweight web-only alternative to the heavy Tauri app (1.7GB) previously built.
