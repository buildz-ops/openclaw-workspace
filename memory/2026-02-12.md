# 2026-02-12

## Vex Self-Audit Report
- Full introspection run using Opus 4.6
- Health score: 62/100 (needs attention)
- Generated HTML report with styled dashboard (41 KB)
- Key findings: 2.3 GB workspace bloat, empty task queue, broken Kimi provider, exec security too permissive

## Immediate Cleanup (Complete)
- Deleted `temp_video/` (35 MB stale frames, 43 JPEGs + video)
- Removed deprecated `gog` skill
- Moved clawtex summaries from memory/ to clawtex/
- Consolidated 9 days of daily logs (2026-02-03 through 2026-02-11) into MEMORY.md
- Committed all changes to git (commit 62f715a)
- Freed: ~36 MB disk + cleaned memory system structure

## Config Changes (Complete)
- Removed broken Kimi K2.5 provider (pointed to deprecated Anyscale endpoint)
- Gateway restarted successfully (commit 9b0d57c)

## Proactive System Activated
- Populated `tasks/QUEUE.md` with real tasks (8 ready, 1 blocked, 5 done today)
- Initialized tracking files: `proactive-tracker.md`, `recurring-patterns.md`, `outcome-journal.md`
- System now fully operational: heartbeat will pick from queue during active hours (08:00-23:00 CET)

## Pending Decisions (Ayoub)
1. **mission-control/ (1.7 GB):** Moved to ~/repos/mission-control, need to remove from workspace + update .gitignore
2. **exec security:** Leave as "full" or restrict globally (per-model restrictions not supported yet)
