## Daily AI Newsletter (21:00 CET)
**Strategy pivot:** Browser automation blocked (no relay tab attached). Used Exa semantic search instead:
- 20 tweets (Feb 13) + 15 general articles via `web_search_advanced_exa` + `web_search_exa`
- **Top stories:** GPT-5.3 vs Opus 4.6, Anthropic $30B raise, Gemini Deep Think, Berkeley self-optimization (98% cost reduction), AlphaScientist-v2, DeepSeek controversy
- **Suggested follows:** @ai (research breakthroughs), @AIFutureBrief (benchmarking)

- **Token usage:** ~26K (well under 300K budget)
- **Note:** Browser scroll-snapshot strategy requires Chrome extension relay tab attachment. Exa alternative worked well for curation.
