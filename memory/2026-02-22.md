## Clawtex VPS Setup (completed 2026-02-18)
- VPS IP: 57.131.40.85 (OVH, Ubuntu 24.04)
- SSH access: `ssh vex@57.131.40.85` (key-only, port 22)
- Docker + docker-compose installed ✅
- UFW firewall active (deny incoming, allow 22/80/443) ✅
- Fail2Ban running ✅
- Automatic security updates enabled ✅
- vex user has full sudo (NOPASSWD) ✅
- SSH port 2222 change was attempted but didn't take effect — SSH remains on port 22 (key-only is sufficient security)
- VPS notes at: `notes/vps-access.md`

## Clawtex DNS Status (as of 2026-02-18 evening)
- `clawtex.com` → Active on Cloudflare ✅
- `clawtex.es` → Nameservers correctly set in GoDaddy (ricardo/ullis.ns.cloudflare.com), but propagation pending as of 2026-02-18
- Ayoub confirmed clawtex.es nameservers correctly set; waiting for propagation
- DNS check scheduled: 2026-02-19 (today may have resolved)
- Cloudflare account: Ayoubammarchaibi@gmail.com (ID: de2357b826b2e45ec3bbb0475a2a5182)

## Pending (Clawtex)
- Arnau's website code not yet received — cannot deploy until code is shared (Git repo or SCP)
- Once code received: deploy on VPS, update Cloudflare A records to 57.131.40.85

## SSH Hardening Lesson Learned
- Multiple failed attempts to change SSH port due to Ubuntu 24.04 socket-based SSH activation (ssh.socket overrides sshd_config Port directive)
- /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ directory (especially 60-cloudimg-settings.conf) can override main sshd_config
- Solution: write to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ directly to override cloud-init defaults
- Always verify listening ports with `ss -tlnp | grep ssh` after restart
- Never restart SSH without confirming key-based login works first
