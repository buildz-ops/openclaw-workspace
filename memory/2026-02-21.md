## Cron Job Fixes (Delivery Failure)
- **Issue:** All major cron jobs (morning-briefing, daily-health-report, weekly-clawtex-summary, daily-ai-brief) were failing with `cron announce delivery failed`. The system-level "announce" mode is unreliable in the current version.
- **Fix:** Edited all 4 jobs to disable built-in delivery (`delivery: none`) and updated their prompts to explicitly use the `message` tool for delivery.
- **Morning Briefing:** Fixed and manually re-run successfully.
- **Daily AI Brief:** Fixed payload to explicitly target channel `1471155181352911093` (yesterday's run failed due to missing target).
