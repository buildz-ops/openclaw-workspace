## Config Changes
- Fresh OpenClaw setup on Mac Mini M4 via `openclaw configure` (version 2026.2.6-3)
- Primary model set to `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` with fallbacks: opus, haiku, sonnet, github-copilot models, gemini-flash
- Discord channel enabled, guild `1466038234600444048` allowlisted
- Added Ayoub's Discord user ID (`281112594348244993`) to guild users list and `commands.ownerAllowFrom` (prefixed `discord:`) to fix `/model` command authorization
- Gateway restarted successfully after config.apply

## Issues Resolved
- Ayoub couldn't use `/model` slash command in Discord — was unauthorized because his user ID wasn't in the guild's `users` array and wasn't in `commands.ownerAllowFrom`
