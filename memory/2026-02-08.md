# 2026-02-08

## Config Changes
- Fresh OpenClaw setup on Mac Mini M4 via `openclaw configure` (version 2026.2.6-3)
- Primary model set to `google/gemini-3-pro-preview` with fallbacks: opus, haiku, sonnet, github-copilot models, gemini-flash
- Discord channel enabled, guild `1466038234600444048` allowlisted
- Added Ayoub's Discord user ID (`281112594348244993`) to guild users list and `commands.ownerAllowFrom` (prefixed `discord:`) to fix `/model` command authorization
- Gateway restarted successfully after config.apply

## Issues Resolved
- Ayoub couldn't use `/model` slash command in Discord — was unauthorized because his user ID wasn't in the guild's `users` array and wasn't in `commands.ownerAllowFrom`

## Opus Setup Batch (all 7 tasks)
1. ✅ HEARTBEAT.md template — written for llama3.2 compatibility
2. ⏳ Discord server org — audited, needs decision on VPS category rename
3. ⏳ ClawdStrike security audit — sub-agent running
4. ✅ AGENTS.md + SOUL.md refinement — both rewritten
5. ⏳ Clawtex doc polish — sub-agent running
6. ✅ Cron jobs: workspace-git-commit (6h), morning-briefing (8am), weekly-clawtex-summary (Fri 6pm)
7. ✅ .learnings/ bootstrapped with ERRORS.md, LEARNINGS.md, FEATURE_REQUESTS.md

## Heartbeat Configured

## Ollama Provider Added
- llama3.2:3b running locally on Mac Mini, registered as ollama/llama3.2:3b (alias: llama)
