## Weekly Usage & System Audit (2026-02-19)

### 📊 Token Usage Crisis
- **Incident:** Massive token burn discovered (~39.4M total tokens).
- **Cause 1:** Rogue agent `asir-minimax` was shadowing the `#ops` channel, duplicating every message with 100k+ context windows.
- **Cause 2:** `openclaw-watchdog-notify` cron (15m interval) was falling back to DeepSeek (paid) due to missing Ollama auth profile on the main agent.
- **Resolution:** Deleted rogue agent directory and added `ollama:default` auth profile to `main` agent.
- **Cost Reduction:** Switched Daily AI Newsletter to `gemini-3-flash-preview` to cut costs by ~90% (now ~$0.05-0.10/day).

### 🛠️ Key System Decisions
- **Outcome Journal Updates:** Marked X Account seed list as complete; kept Mission Control source code for showcase purposes (no active binaries).
- **Heartbeat Protocol:** Silenced heartbeat auto-messages to Discord per user request; heartbeat now runs internal-only unless critical.
- **Security:** Cleaned hardcoded GitHub PAT and Brave API keys from `config/mcporter.json`; rewritten git history to remove traces; configured macOS keychain for secure git operations.

### 👥 Clawtex Team Update
- **Confirmed Team:** OnguitoWa, Cristo, and Winson (joining soon).
- **Correction:** Prior team members (Carlos, Navas, Gerson) from initial planning are no longer the focus; OnguitoWa and Cristo are the active collaborators.
- **Model Scaling:** Decided that **Max 5x ($100/mo)** is the necessary floor for OAuth usage to support the multi-agent/multi-user load without hitting rate limits.

### ⚙️ Model Configuration
- **Primary Model Change:** Updated globally to `google/gemini-3-flash-preview` per user request to optimize for speed/cost.
- **Pricing Audit:** Conducted a cost comparison for Claude 4.6 (Opus vs Sonnet) across API and OAuth (Pro/Max) plans. Sonnet 4.6 API is ~$1.25/day for normal use; Max 5x is ~$3.33/day but provides unlimited capacity for the team.
