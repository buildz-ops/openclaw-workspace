## Weekly Usage & System Audit (2026-02-19)

### 📊 Token Usage Crisis
- **Incident:** Massive token burn discovered (~39.4M total tokens).
- **Cause 1:** Rogue agent `asir-minimax` was shadowing the `#ops` channel, duplicating every message with 100k+ context windows.
- **Cause 2:** `openclaw-watchdog-notify` cron (15m interval) was falling back to DeepSeek (paid) due to missing Ollama auth profile on the main agent.
- **Resolution:** Deleted rogue agent directory and added `ollama:default` auth profile to `main` agent.
- **Cost Reduction:** Switched Daily AI Newsletter to `gemini-3-flash-preview` to cut costs by ~90% (now ~$0.05-0.10/day).

### 🛠️ Key System Decisions
- **Outcome Journal Updates:** Marked X Account seed list as complete; kept Mission Control source code for showcase purposes (no active binaries).
- **Heartbeat Protocol:** Silenced heartbeat auto-messages to Discord per user request; heartbeat now runs internal-only unless critical.
- **Security:** Cleaned hardcoded GitHub PAT and Brave API keys from `config/mcporter.json`; rewritten git history to remove traces; configured macOS keychain for secure git operations.

### 🚦 Rate-Limit & Stability Moments
- **Ollama/Llama:** Fixed fallback loops by ensuring local auth profiles exist.
- **Morning Briefing:** Identified failures due to model alias misconfigurations; corrected by adding local provider auth.
- **OpenClaw Update:** Successfully upgraded to **v2026.2.14**.
