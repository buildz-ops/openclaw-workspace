## Tasks
- **gog Authentication:** Attempting to authenticate `gog` CLI for Gmail.
  - Found `client_secret.json` at `/Users/vex/.openclaw/secrets/client_secret.json`.
  - Initiated `gog auth add`.
  - Encountered `invalid_grant` error during code exchange despite successful curl to callback. Likely timing issue or code reuse.
  - Next step: Retry auth flow with fresh URL and faster turn-around.

## Errors
- `gog auth`: "invalid_grant" "Bad Request" during token exchange.
